## User Experience UX

### Site Purpose

The quiz is designed to challenge users on general football trivia. There are 10 questions to answer, and for each question, the user is informed immediately if they answered the question correctly or not. When the user selects an answer, if they are correct the answer will turn green and the 'correct' counter underneath will increment by one. If the user gets the answer wrong, the selected answer will highlight red, the correct answer will be shown in green and the 'incorrect' counter will increment by one. Once the user has answered all 10 questions, a message is displayed on the screen displaying the correct number of answers and asking if they would like to take the quiz again.

### Target Audience

This quiz is for anybody who wants to test their general football knowledge or just wants to have a bit of fun to pass some time.

### Communication

The overall design of the site has been made very simple on purpose to help learn the very basics of JavaScript. When the user arrives on the site, the landing page shows 4 bullet points explaining what to expect with the quiz. Once the user clicks 'start quiz' the questions, answers and score are then displayed on the screen. The visual structureof the site makes it intuitive to navigate through the ten questions. The game displays the final score after answering the last question and gives the option to play the game again.

### User Goals

As a user taking the quiz, I want to be challenged on my knowledge of football and also learn the answers to the questions I got wrong. I want to be entertained for a brief time and know my final score at the end. Once the quiz has finished I would like the option to play again and see if I learnt the correct answers from the ones I got incorrect on the previous go.

### Future Implementations

My future plans for the site are to add a lot more questions, with the questions displaying in a random order and have 3 different difficulty levels so the quiz would be more suitable for a wider audience. I would also like to add a countdown timer to each question to add more fun and for the user to have to think quicker.
